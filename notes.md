#Slides
* slide: community
    * friendly
    * liberal (mostly MIT license, as Lua itself)
    * academic
    * hardly ever consensus on standards (hence 3 standard libraries)
* slide: Advanced Lua; Template engines and sandboxes
    * template engine (LuaDoc)
    * sandboxes (Cosmo, also template engine)
* slide: Advanced Lua; Metatables & meta methods
    * Luassert as example (__index and __call)
    * OO as example  (__index)
    * comparison metamethods
* slide: Advanced Lua; multi-threading/code parallelism
    * difference between co-routines and os-threads
    * re-use co-routines for different purposes; producer consumer model (LTN12)
* slide: Try Lua yourself
